|         KOOMPI PROMPT          |
==================================

Koompi is the first community ever in Cambodia to take
action  about free and open source softwares, and successfully
created their own Operating System (OS) over Arch Linux
called Kroma OS.

I am really fascinated about Koompi, and I hope that I would
somehow be accepted to join their community. And that's why
I want to write this script.

It is just a shell script, and most of them are copied from
<ufetch>. The Koompi logo, on the other hand, is rendered by
a programm call <jp2a>. Issue the following command:

$ jp2a --width=30 --chars="   .*@*0@" koompi.jpg
             *  *
            *@  @0
          .0@@  @@@.
        .0@@@@  @@@@0.
      @0@@@@@0  0@@@@@0@
  *@0@@@@@@0@    @0@@@@@@0@*

  .@0@@@@@@@*    @0@@@@@@0@.
      *0@@@@@@  @@@@@@0*
        .0@@@@  @@@@0.
          .0@@  @@0.
            *@  @*
             *  *

I really hope you'll like it.
